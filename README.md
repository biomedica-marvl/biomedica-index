**Welcome to the official Biomedica Index Repository!**

This is a new consumable version of the BIOMEDICA Archive, allowing multimodal retrieval of similar images, captions, and full-text articles.

## Quickstart
### Online Demo
For quick trial/demo purposes, use this **Colab notebook:**

https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15qyeCCY7nlgSnNstJw9kVLHwlvIUZieB?usp=sharing

See also the Mounting Data section below.

### Local Setup
Code:
```
pip install "biomedica-index[all] @ git+https://github.com/biomedica-marvl/biomedica-index.git"
```

Download (or mount) the **Google Drive folder of necessary index data**:

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MM3-birHJobagiznDZYfHtbFpkuawuPN?usp=drive_link


## Installation
To install the full capabilities of the index, run the following command in the environment of your choice:
```
pip install "biomedica-index[all] @ git+https://github.com/biomedica-marvl/biomedica-index.git"
```

For more specific use cases, we provide the following options:
- `biomedica-index` (no \[brackets\]): Installs minimal dependencies for keyword/BM25-based retrieval, or for vector-based search if `torch`, `torchvision`, and/or `transformers` were installed separately.
- `bimomedica-index[text]`: For the full range of text-based search capabilities.
- `biomedica-index[image]`: For image-based search capabilities (but not vector-based text capabilities).
- `biomedica-index[all]`: Installs the full index.

## How to query the Biomedica Index
To make the Biomedica dataset queryable, we currently provide two major tools: 
- `BiomedicaIndex`: used to retrieve identifying metadata on relevant articles and figures, given text or image prompts
- `BiomedicaArticleLoader`: loads full-text article data (the title, abstract, and publish date), given identifying metadata

For full use, we currently require the data needed for the index to be downloaded locally on the user's machine. Available data for the current index functionality is downloadable [from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MM3-birHJobagiznDZYfHtbFpkuawuPN?usp=drive_link). A more practical solution is currently in development, but we release this version to allow interested parties access to the index as quickly as possible.

For a simple initial trial, we have provided a simple [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15qyeCCY7nlgSnNstJw9kVLHwlvIUZieB?usp=sharing) for initial testing. To use it, please also see the Mounting Data section below. 

Minimal snippet for articles:
```python
import biomedica_index as bi
index = bi.BiomedicaIndex(INDEX_PATH)
loader = bi.BiomedicaArticleLoader(INDEX_PATH)
text_query = 'article search query'
top_articles = index.query_articles(text=text_query, top_k=5, subsets='all')
for metadata, score in top_articles:
    print(metadata['pmcid'], metadata['subset'])
    title, article_body, unix_date = loader.get_article(metadata)
    # do stuff with the article data
```

For figures:
```python
import biomedica_index as bi
from PIL import Image
index = bi.BiomedicaIndex(INDEX_PATH)
query_image = Image.open('my_query_image.jpg')
query_text = 'caption search query'
top_figures = index.query_figures(image=query_image, text=query_text, text_mode='all', \
                                  top_k=5, subsets=['noncommercial'])
```

For full details on how to use this package, please see the API reference section below.

### Mounting Data
Instead of downloading the full data, the folder can also be mounted using [Google Drive for desktop](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/10838124) or using Google Colab. To achieve this, please open the [Google Drive link to the folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MM3-birHJobagiznDZYfHtbFpkuawuPN?usp=drive_link) and follow these instructions to add the shared folder as a shortcut within your main Drive:
- Click on the bmca_index name at the top (the folder name)
- Select Organize > Add shortcut
    - This will add a "symlink" to the shared folder within your Google Drive account, making the folder accessible if you mount your main drive anywhere.

## Data
The Google Drive folder contains the following sub-directories:
- `ARTICLES` contains batches of full-text articles and is used by the `BiomedicaArticleLoader` to retrieve a full-text article given its PMCID.
- `full_text-kw` contains the BM25 pre-computed index needed to compute the **most relevant articles** given a user query.
- `caption-kw` contains the BM25 pre-computed index needed to compute the **most relevant figure captions** given a user query.
- `caption` contains the ChromaDB vector databases needed to use **vector-based caption search**.
- `image` contains the ChromaDB vector databases needed to use **vector-based image search**.
